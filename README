#3D Printing Projects
 This repo has a ton of files of all my work I've worked on throughout the years and some you've seen posted on instagram. There's tons of variations and file types for mainly miata parts. However, I also worked on projects for friends that aren't miatas. This includes cosplay parts, e30 parts, 240sx parts, and generic fit parts.
