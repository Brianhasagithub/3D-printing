# Summary

Logitech G27 shifter is really arcadey feel so I made this to stiffen up the shift feel. The feel can be stiffened further if the 'bumps' on the slider piece are scaled up or the side walls are 1 layer thicker each. The feel change is most noticeable when going to 1st or 6th gear (and reverse). 

The 'leather' boot must be screwed back in place. It will require some pulling to fit it over the edges to make a super tight fitment. 

EDIT: There is SOME success to be made with the G29 shifter. Thanks Salvadoor for posting a photo! Frende21 stated that the front 2 screws do NOT fit back on with this mod on the G29 shifter but that should all the rest to fit on. If I ever get my hands on a G29 I will redesign one specifically for that. Chances are slim though.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Mk2
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: .35mm
Infill: HoneyComb

Notes: 
Vertical Shell Perimeter is 2
Horizontal Shell Top is 2 and Bottom is 3
Infill at 10% Honeycomb. Change if you are heavy handed shifter or using long-throw.
Takes about 20 minutes to print. Low-precision is alright.

# Post-Printing

## Small Slider piece

Make sure to lube it up. I used grease from Lucas oil products. If the small part is not lubed then the shifter will not return to center. Also lube up the rest of the mechanics inside the shifter while it is open since this mod will make the shifter feel 'grainy'.

# How I Designed This

## Struggles

I think I printed 8 prototypes before getting it JUST right. The project started off as replacing the leather boot with a Gated H pattern but I couldn't figure out how to measure the curve of the shifter base. I instead went for a model that goes underneath the leather boot.
