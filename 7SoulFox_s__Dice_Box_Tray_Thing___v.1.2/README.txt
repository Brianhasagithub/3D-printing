# Summary

#Greetings and Salutations fellow adventurers!
---

*** Please Note that the photos showcase the old prototype of the design which featured numerous errors resulting in warping, and layering. The released version should be smooth and stable. ***

In light of beginning a new D&D campaign, I came to a sudden conclusion upon catching that tabletop bug. *"I MUST PRINT ALL THE THINGS"*.

After calming myself down over a glass of tea and a bucket of donuts, I realized that *1. Most designs I found online didn't quite suit my taste or needs*, and *2. Ain't nobody got time to design and print everything*. And thus, this project was born.

   So what is it exactly? Is it a dice box for storing your dice? Is it a dice Tray for rolling dice? Will it likely cause me to expend all of my money on filament so that I may print boxes for all my friends?

**_The Answer is Yes!_**

---

####**Introducing the *"Dice Box/ Tray/ Thing" v.1.x*! **

   ***Print today and enjoy all of it's glorious features, such as:***

+ Ample room for rolling all of your favorite dice! *(and that one you stole from Tim)*
+ A fabulous dice compartment for holding up to 5 sets of dice`! *(That's one more whole set than 4!)*
+ A decorative compartment cover for really showcasing your inner you! 
+ A drawer built into the side allowing you to smuggle all sorts of knickknacks into your gaming sessions``! Or use it for pencils. *Most likely pencils*.

Although future designs are almost certainty going to be released going forward, I highly encourage you to comment any suggestions or issues you may have so that I may promptly and eloquently ignore them. *Not really though, that would be rude*.

***Download, Enjoy, and Adventure on my friends!***

If you do enjoy what I have procured, consider leaving a tip. Any amount helps, and will only help further inflate my ego to disastrous proportions. In turn, I will be obliged to continue creating and submitting my designs mostly free of charge.

*` Dice storage based off 5 sets of standard sized dice. Larger or specialty dice may not properly fit, and may require adjustment. Quick Fix: Scale up box Top Half in the Z (Vertical) Direction ONLY. May result in unwanted gawking at your unnecessarily large box. You've been warned.*

*`` I do not condone the smuggling of unknown objects into your gaming sessions. If you do not heed my advice, the DM might inflict an untimely demise for your character. DMs: If you are reading this, The player's choice to bring in prohibited items was neither condoned by me or mine. If you wish to punish the unruly player, might I suggest death by rabid chicken.*



# Print Settings

Printer: Creality CR-10
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 15% - 20%

Notes: 
+ **SUPPORTS RECOMMENDED** on the storage tray as the handle has a pretty steep overhang. All other parts should print fine without them.

+ Pending your printer's printable area, box scaling may need to be altered to fit. Remember to alter all parts to the same scaling percentages as failure to do so may result in a deformed monstrosity. And neither of us want that.


+ I recommend using Wood filament as it provides the most traditional look and feel, though any filament should work in theory. It has the added bonus of allowing layer lines to look like layers in the wood, which helps hide the fact that it was 3d printed.



# Post-Printing

## Assembly/Cleanup

So you've printed your box and want to know what to do next. In only a few easy steps you can have your box up and running and ready to hold ~~all~~ *~~Most~~* ***A good portion*** of your glorious dice!

+ **(OPTIONAL)** For a slightly stiffer side drawer, consider gluing down some felt on the bottom drawer cavity. This might help prevent unwanted drawer slippage and will help keep things secure during travel.

+ Line the bottom half of the box with glue, making sure to place some extra on top of each of the registration pegs (the 2 cylinders and the L in the corners).

+ Line up the top half, and push firmly down, ensuring both halves are aligned. There's is a bit of 'wiggle room' on the pegs, so you may have to manually align the box to it's final location.

+ After properly aligning, clamp down both halves with steady and even pressure to ensure proper adhesion.

+ Sand away rough edges and excess glue, making sure to clean off the side tray in order to ensure smooth movement.

+ Ensure drawer slides smoothly yet securely, adding additional felt to the bottom of the drawer as needed.

+ Place dice into dice cavity, and cover with your choice of insert.

### Enjoy!
